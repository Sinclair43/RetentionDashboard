# Retention Dashboard

### Dashboard Link : Coming Soon

## Problem Statement

Senior Leadership needed to better understand employee retention and came to me to help revamp the process and create a tool to visualize the data. While I can't go into the process here, I can link the dashboard with made up data. The dashboard is a continuously evolving tool that is shown once a week during senior leadership meetings. Data comes together from internal reports sent and added into the dataset via Powerautomate to create a dynamic tool.
